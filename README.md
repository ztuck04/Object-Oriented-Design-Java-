Objected Oriented Programming Java Assignment from Summer 2024

Bicycle.java: This is the blueprint for a bike. It keeps track of the bike's cadence, speed, and gear. gearDown() prevents the gear from ever going below zero.

Biker.java: This represents a person who "owns" a bike. It acts as a controller; when the Biker "shifts up" or "speeds up," the code sends a command to the Bicycle object to change its members.

LousyBikeMechanic.java: This class is designed to show how one object can modify another.

Driver.java: This is the main (driver) file. Serves as a way to test objects' functionality.
